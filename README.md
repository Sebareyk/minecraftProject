## Notes
This project contains many systems implemented as states, there is the Chest state, the Crafting state, Furnace state, Generator state and Enchantment state. Each of the states holds it's own functionality within the game, the chest being able to hold weapons, the crafting being able to create items using specific recipes, Furnace state being able to cook certain items, generator being able to produce items using tools, and enchanting state making tools more efficient in their respective loot pools.
